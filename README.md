A project which uses the [jxm/the_office_lines](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jxm/the_office_lines/blob/main/README.md) dataset to create a game based on the American version of The Office

To run the quiz in the terminal, type `python officeTrivia.py`

To run the quiz in the front end, type `flask run`

To run the Playwright tests, type `npm run test`. This script uses 'concurrently' to start the server and then run the tests.
