# The Office Quiz

A project which uses the [jxm/the_office_lines](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jxm/the_office_lines/blob/main/README.md) dataset to create a quiz based on the American version of The Office.

To run the quiz in the front end, type `npm run app`. This will run the app here: http://127.0.0.1:5000.

To run the Playwright tests, type `npm run tests`.

The data for the Allure report will be created in the script above.

To generate the Allure report, type `npm run generate-allure`.
